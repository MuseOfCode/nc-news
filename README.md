# NC News Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of **NC News**, a React-based news aggregation platform built during my time at [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/). This project consumes a RESTful API I built for the backend and allows users to browse, sort as well as interact with articles.

Originally, I styled this app with a **pixel-art aesthetic** but after my final project at Northcorders which was a collaborative **RPG-style game** built with other talented developers, I was inspired to **reboot the project** with a cleaner, more refined design. My goal now is to give it a modern, accessible interface and expand its capabilities further.

 ## Thanks for Reading

This project has evolved alongside me, from pixel art beginnings to a more refined, responsive design.  

Thanks to earlier versions, I’ve had the chance to experiment with frameworks and tools like Tailwind CSS, deepening both my technical toolkit and creative approach.

It’s still growing with more features, polish, etc.

Feel free to fork or drop by with feedback or ideas :)
